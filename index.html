<h1>Virtual SIM Card</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Virutal Subscriber Identity Module</h2>
<strong><i>Telephony as a Service</i></strong>
</page>


<page>
<h1>What ?</h1>
<pre>
- an implementation of the (U)SIM functionality inside the terminal device 
    instead of in a separate physical module (UICC).

  * USIM - Universal Subscriber Identity Module
    - Security Module for UMTS. as opposed to the SIM card, 
      this term denotes the logical application
      performing the SIM functionality, and not the physical card itself (see UICC).
  * UICC - Universal Integrated Circuit Card
    - Multi-application smart card platform used in mobile 
      telecommunication networks.
      e.g. an USIM application in the case of UMTS
  * UMTS - Univeral Mobile Telecommunications System

- like Cloud data storage
- other types (APPLE) Soft SIM
  collection of software applicatoins and data that perform all of the functionallity.
  it would be stored in the memory and processor of the commuications device itself.

</pre>
</page>


<page>
<h1>Why ?</h1>
<pre>
- first SIM is the physically secured module which contains the IMSI, 
  key and security related information and fuctions

- In order to differentiating features in the terminal. 
  so SIM card had been evolved

- It have to modify the internal SIM card to store more data.

- then Virtual SIM has been happened to stop this evolution

</pre>
</page>


<page>
<h1>Why ? (cont)</h1>
<pre>
- GSM standards where established in such way 
  the a removable smart card was to be used

- SIMEG(SIM Expert Group) considered fixed SIM 
  but was rejected because

- there was no viable way to securely store 
  the secret algorithm and subscriber key inther terminal.

- there was the problem of how to load the key 
  and algorithm in ther terminal
- It could be a commercial barrier

- Today's consumers use dual- and triple-SIM handsets tablits, 
  USB modems, and many other typs of connected devices.

<page>
<h1>Pros</h1>
<pre>
- It's low-cost. no logistics necessary for distribution to end-users.

- create new ways of selling subscriptions

- Any SIM anywhere anytime

- Mobile Terminals can be installed anywhere without a local SIM

- Global Roaming
</pre>
</page>


<page>
<h1>Cons</h1>
<pre>
- SIM vendor become obsolete and disappear from ecosystem
</pre>
</page>


<page>
<h1>How ?</h1>
<pre>
- core concept is to multiplex idectification data from SIM cards 
  of differenct mobile service providers combined 
  in one virtual SIM-card.

- Terminals connect to distributed SIM server

- there's software part being a core of VSIM

- Its responsible for algorithms of swichting over 
  between loaded SIM cards of differenct mobile service providers.

- SIM card loading means receiving data for the 
  subscriber's authentication in a mobile network of 
  a new mobile service provider with assignment of a new phone number.

- SIM server
